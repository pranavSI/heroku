        "subtitle": "The lions bring to life the phrase 'Sher-e-Punjab', which literally means 'Lions of Punjab'. Symbolically, the two lions represent Maharaj Ranjit Singh, the most intelligent and powerful ruler of North India and the erstwhile Maharaja of Patiala, Bhupinder Singh. The latter was the first Indian to lead an Indian cricket team to Lordâ€™s in 1911 and was instrumental in setting up of the BCCI."
